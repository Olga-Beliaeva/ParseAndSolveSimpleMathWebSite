# ParsingProjectGH

**This mini-project is created to demonstrate skills in:*

- web parsing

- creating a custom module

- using external solutions and adapting them to one's own needs

The main file is solve_math_problem.py. 

We take a certain website with math problems and select problems of the 2nd grade of varying difficulty.

We are readty to solve only simple binary problems (*/+-):

- with  solve_math_problm.py we filter them and 

- by formula_filter_test.py we return them in a certain format and then

- by formula_parser.py we return solutions

By solve_math_problem.py  solutions are entered into appropriate answer boxes, 
"check answer"buttons  and "see solution" buttons are clicked, 
and the answers are printed into inner Terminal.
